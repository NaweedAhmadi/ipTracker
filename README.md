<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://new-ip-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

This is a solution to the IP Address Tracker challenge from the Frontend Mentor. To get the IP Address locations, we utilized the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

The users are able to:
* View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
* See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
* Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location
